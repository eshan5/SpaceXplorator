👩‍🚀🌌👨‍🚀Space mission success rate analysis based on the solar power using Artificial Neural Networks📡🛰️
The varied planetary surfaces and space objects experience a wide range of temperatures, gravity, radiation, rock and mineral types, that must be understood to design spacecraft, landing systems, life support, space suites and ISRU systems. This repo consists of three files.
1) First one contains the exploratory data analysis of all the space missions from 1957.
2) Next one contains the machine learning models for time series forecasting to analyze the success rate of the space missions carried out by various agencies.
3) Final one contains the ANN Model predicting the solar radiation using remote sensing data.
